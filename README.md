## Running the Code

### Dependencies

`Keras 2.1.2`

### Command-line Execution

## Modeling the English Language using LSTMs.

### Objective

Use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to model the English language by modeling its words.

For this purpose, and in order to train the model, the following pieces of literature were downloaded from [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.ca/index.html):

* 1
* 2
* 3

### Details

Given a single word, the network should be able to create a full coherent sentence. However, it should also be able to support situations where, instead, a sentence or a paragraph is provided. In this case, the output should be subsequent sentences and paragraphs.
